# VECTOR AND EMBEDDING - NOTES

# 1. VECTOR

# Definition:
# A vector is a one-dimensional array (list) of numbers.

# Example:

# v = np.array([42, 56])

# Output:

# [42 56]

# More Examples:

# salary = np.array([10000, 20000, 30000])

# marks = np.array([80, 90, 95])

# Interview Answer:
# A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers used to represent data mathematically.

# Memory Trick:
# Vector = List of Numbers


# --------------------------------------------------


# 2. EMBEDDING

# Definition:
# An embedding is a special vector that represents the meaning of data such as text, images, or audio.

# Example:

# Text:

# "I love AI"

# ↓

# Embedding Model

# ↓

# [0.25, -0.09, 0.82]

# The vector:

# [0.25, -0.09, 0.82]

# is called an Embedding Vector.

# Interview Answer:
# An embedding is a numerical vector representation of text, image, or audio that captures meaning.

# Memory Trick:
# Embedding = Meaningful Vector


# --------------------------------------------------


# VECTOR vs EMBEDDING

# Example 1:

# salary = [10000, 20000, 30000]

# Result:

# Vector      = YES
# Embedding   = NO

# Reason:
# These are just salary values.


# Example 2:

# "I love AI"

# ↓

# [0.25, -0.09, 0.82]

# Result:

# Vector      = YES
# Embedding   = YES

# Reason:
# The vector represents the meaning of text.


# --------------------------------------------------


# IMPORTANT RULE

# All Embeddings are Vectors.

# But

# Not All Vectors are Embeddings.
